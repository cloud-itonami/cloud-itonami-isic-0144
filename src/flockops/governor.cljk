(ns flockops.governor
  "Flock Operations Governor -- the independent compliance layer that
  earns the FlockOpsAdvisor the right to commit. The LLM has no notion
  of:
    - Whether the facility a proposal targets is actually registered
    - Whether a proposal is a real actuation (`:effect :propose` only --
      this actor NEVER directly handles animals, administers treatment,
      or executes anything)
    - Whether an op is inside this actor's closed coordination allowlist
    - Whether a logged flock count is a plausible positive observation
    - Whether a supply-order's cost exceeds the escalation threshold

  This MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  This actor is a back-office FARM OPERATIONS COORDINATOR only -- direct
  animal handling and veterinary treatment/culling decisions are
  categorically outside its authority (farm operator/veterinarian
  exclusive). The Governor enforces that boundary structurally, not by
  trusting the advisor's judgment.

  CRITICAL: Any proposal to flag an animal health or welfare concern
  (e.g. suspected scrapie or bluetongue, unexplained mortality spike)
  ALWAYS escalates to a human (farm operator/veterinarian) for final
  sign-off. The LLM's confidence is never sufficient for animal-welfare
  decisions -- and this actor never itself declares an outbreak or
  contacts animal-health authorities.

  Hard violations (always HOLD, no override, permanent):
    1. Facility not registered (facility-id missing or unknown to Store)
    2. Proposal `:effect` is not `:propose` (no direct execution, ever)
    3. Op is `:administer-treatment` or `:finalize-culling-decision` --
       direct treatment administration and finalizing a culling decision
       are PERMANENTLY blocked regardless of proposal content or
       confidence
    4. Op is outside the closed proposal-op allowlist
    5. `:log-husbandry-record` with a non-positive flock count

  Soft gates (always escalate for human):
    - `:flag-animal-health-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates
    - `:order-supplies` above its category cost threshold
    - Low confidence

  This design mirrors `swineops.governor` (cloud-itonami-isic-0145) but
  specializes sheep-and-goat farm back-office coordination concerns
  (facility registration, closed op allowlist, treatment/culling
  exclusion, cost threshold, health/welfare-concern escalation) rather
  than swine-specific biosecurity/farrowing concerns."
